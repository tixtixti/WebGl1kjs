WebGL 1kjs demo

Inspired by ASM16 1k intro combo I wanted to go look what can we be made with WebGl ja html5 canvas element. This is very first time I'm making anykind of intro/demo so there will not be anything fancy.

Currently following MDN WebGL tutorial.

Hopefully there will be one single (executable?) index.html file which contains everything and is less or equal 1024 bytes.
